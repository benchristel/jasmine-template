# Jasmine Test Template

Setting up a new Javascript project with Jasmine specs can be a pain. You have to go download the Jasmine source from their website, or hunt around your other projects for the Jasmine libs and copy them to your new project. Well, not anymore. Just do this:

```bash
curl -o https://raw.githubusercontent.com/benchristel/jasmine-template/master/spec.html spec.html
```

and add script tags for your source files. Done!
